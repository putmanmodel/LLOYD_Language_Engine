# TODO: Capture drift plot screenshot for README after sample session
# Suggest scenario: calm baseline → rising incoming tension → spike in Δ

Yes — you’ve already built a strong foundation for a standout README. Here’s a checklist of everything we’ve discussed that can boost the final README and make it shine for future users, collaborators, or curious developers:

✅ README Boost Checklist (based on our discussion)

1. 🌀 Clear Project Summary

LLOYD: Language Layer Over Your Data
A symbolic drift detector and narrative tone tracker. Designed to detect when a conversation shifts emotionally, symbolically, or empathically — not just semantically.

⸻

2. 🧪 Drift Detection Demo
	•	CLI interface that logs baseline vs. incoming phrases
	•	JSONL journal output with drift flags and rationale
	•	Sample output snippet (copy-paste example block)
	•	Graph screenshot placeholder

{"baseline": "I love this.", "incoming": "I hate this.", "drift": true, "rationale": "Polarity shift from 0.50 → -1.00 (Δ=-1.50)"}


⸻

3. 📊 Drift Graph Explanation
	•	Drift score over time → seismograph of emotional breaks
	•	Placeholder screenshot section (added above)
	•	Plan to show symbolic tension escalation

⸻

4. 🧠 Symbolic Emphasis Notes
	•	Optional override logic based on symbolic weight (e.g. “my heart” ≠ literal)
	•	Mention plans for fragment overrides, poetic tag mapping, or token weighting in future versions

⸻

5. 💾 Data + CLI Notes
	•	CLI usage: python cli_drift_test.py
	•	Analyzer usage: python analyze_session.py
	•	Sample session.jsonl file structure
	•	Reminder not to commit nltk_data or venv/ (add .gitignore tip)

⸻

6. 🔮 Future Integration with Spanda
	•	Tease future fusion with Spanda symbolic engine
	•	Optional tag: “Designed to sync with resonance fields and symbolic memory tracking”

⸻

7. 💡 Why This Matters

Most sentiment trackers stop at polarity.
LLOYD tracks the moment meaning breaks — when something is emotionally misaligned, symbolically hostile, or empathically off.
This makes it ideal for building emotionally intelligent bots, UI feedback systems, or symbolic AI agents.

⸻

8. 🚀 Quickstart + Requirements
	•	pip install -r requirements.txt
	•	Python 3.11+ virtual environment setup instructions
	•	Option to run sample test entries (you can include a small .jsonl in /examples/)

⸻

Want me to generate a polished README.md with all these baked in when you’re ready? Or a skeleton version to fill in?

### 🧠 Coming Soon: Advanced Symbolic Drift Detection <-- should read "Currently In Development and Coming Soon"

LLOYD is evolving beyond polarity-based tone tracking. Planned enhancements include:

- Sarcasm hints via ellipsis (`...`) and rhetorical questions (`?`)
- Mocked echo detection with emphasis escalation
- Symbolic negation triggers (`not`, `don’t`, `never`)
- Emoji-based emphasis scoring
- Lightweight slang polarity mapping (`meh`, `stoked`, etc.)
- Multi-turn memory pool with weighted decay

⚡ These will help LLOYD catch subtle emotional breaks — especially in sarcastic, passive-aggressive, or mimicked tone shifts.

💾 **Coming soon: data donation welcome.**  
If you're building chat systems, UIs, or symbolic agents, your anonymized samples can help shape the model.

🧠 Drift Memory (NEW)

DriftMemory adds lightweight short-term memory to track recent drift scores.
When tension builds over several turns (e.g., repeated passive aggression), the system will amplify its rationale accordingly.
memory = DriftMemory()
result = analyze_drift("I'm fine", "I SAID I'M FINE!!!", memory=memory)

⚡ Field Responsiveness

Each DriftResult is tagged as "reactive", "proactive", or "neutral", based on tone trajectory.

	•	Use this to distinguish whether the speaker is escalating or replying defensively.
	•	Helpful for modeling conversational flow or emotional causality.

📚 Override Arbitration (Tiering)

analyze_drift() prioritizes tone overrides by strength:
symbolic_override (100)
mocked_echo (90)
sarcasm_hint (80)
negation_amplified (70)
...

Only the strongest match triggers a drift label, ensuring predictable override behavior.

⸻


🚧 Future Version (v1.1 or v2.0)
	•	Weight override tiers using memory decay + emotional pressure buildup
	•	Model recursive override reinforcement
	•	Allow memory to suppress false positives (e.g., one sarcastic line doesn’t = full override if history is stable)
	🧾 What the README Will Say (Soft Disclaimer + Flexibility)

Two very honest, helpful statements:

✅ 1. Calibration is Limited, but Customizable

“Due to data constraints, LLOYD is lightly calibrated, but designed for easy adaptation to domain-specific tone models.”

	•	This buys you leeway while inviting contributors
	•	Also opens door to GoEmotions integration, customer-specific tone schemas, etc.

✅ 2. Work-in-Progress (WIP) with Feedback Welcome

“LLOYD is an active work in progress. If you’re interested in contributing ideas, testing use cases, or discussing improvements, I’d love to hear from you. (contact: putmanmodel@pm.me)”

	•	Personal, open, honest
	•	Keeps ownership but invites collaboration
	•	Sets tone that this is not a finished black box, but a system becoming more human
